# Auth System Debugging Guide

## Issue Fixed: Login Not Working After Signup

### Problem
- Users were created successfully in Appwrite
- Login would not work - nothing happened
- Users couldn't access other pages

### Root Cause
The `account.deleteSessions()` method requires an authenticated session to work. When we tried to call it before login (when no session exists), it would fail, causing issues with session creation.

### Solution Applied

**File: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**

#### Before (Broken):
```typescript
const login = async (email: string, password: string) => {
    // This fails when no session exists!
    await account.deleteSessions();  // ❌ Requires auth
    
    await account.createEmailPasswordSession(email, password);
}
```

#### After (Fixed):
```typescript
const login = async (email: string, password: string) => {
    // Only delete current session if it exists
    try {
        const currentSession = await account.getSession('current');
        if (currentSession) {
            await account.deleteSession('current');  // ✅ Safe
        }
    } catch {
        // No session exists - this is fine for login
    }
    
    await account.createEmailPasswordSession(email, password);
}
```

### Changes Made

1. **Signup Function:**
   - Removed unnecessary `deleteSessions()` call
   - Directly creates account and session
   - Simpler and more reliable

2. **Login Function:**
   - Changed from `deleteSessions()` to `getSession('current')` + `deleteSession('current')`
   - Only deletes if a session actually exists
   - Safer error handling
   - Added detailed console logging

3. **Auth Page:**
   - Added console logging for debugging
   - Better error display

## How to Test

### Test 1: Create New Account
```
1. Go to /auth
2. Click "Register for free"
3. Fill in:
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: password123
4. Click "Sign up"

Expected: 
✅ Account created
✅ Auto-logged in
✅ Redirected to /auth/details
```

### Test 2: Login with Existing Account
```
1. Go to /auth
2. Fill in email and password
3. Click "Sign in"

Expected:
✅ Login successful
✅ Redirected to /role
✅ Can access protected pages
```

### Test 3: Session Persistence
```
1. Login to account
2. Refresh page
3. Navigate to different pages

Expected:
✅ Still logged in after refresh
✅ Can access all protected routes
✅ User data persists
```

## Debugging Steps

### Check Browser Console

Open browser DevTools (F12) and check Console tab for these messages:

**During Login:**
```
Attempting login...
No current session to delete  // If no existing session
Login successful
```

**During Signup:**
```
Attempting signup...
Signup successful
```

**Any Errors:**
Look for red error messages - they will show the exact issue

### Check Application Tab

In DevTools > Application > Cookies:

1. Look for cookie named: `a_session_[your-project-id]`
2. It should have:
   - Value: Long string (session secret)
   - Domain: Your domain
   - Expires: Future date
   - HttpOnly: ✓
   - Secure: ✓ (in production)

### Check Network Tab

In DevTools > Network:

**During Login:**
```
Request to Appwrite:
POST https://[region].cloud.appwrite.io/v1/account/sessions/email
Status: 201 Created
Response: Session object with secret
```

**After Login:**
```
Request to Appwrite:
GET https://[region].cloud.appwrite.io/v1/account
Status: 200 OK
Response: User object with ID, name, email
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Invalid credentials" Error

**Symptoms:**
- Error message shown in UI
- Login fails

**Causes:**
- Wrong email or password
- User doesn't exist
- Password too short

**Solutions:**
- Verify credentials are correct
- Check password is at least 8 characters
- Try creating a new account

### Issue 2: Nothing Happens on Login

**Symptoms:**
- Click login button
- No error shown
- No redirect
- Still on login page

**Causes:**
- JavaScript error (check console)
- Network error
- Session creation failed

**Solutions:**
```javascript
// Check browser console for errors
// Look for these logs:
"Attempting login..."  // Should see this
"Login successful"     // Should see this after

// If you see an error, it will show between these
```

### Issue 3: Logged In But Can't Access Pages

**Symptoms:**
- Login works
- Immediately redirected back to login
- Or stuck in redirect loop

**Causes:**
- Session cookie not set
- Middleware not detecting session
- Invalid session

**Solutions:**
1. Clear all cookies
2. Try logging in again
3. Check cookie is set (DevTools > Application > Cookies)
4. Verify project ID matches Appwrite console

### Issue 4: Session Doesn't Persist

**Symptoms:**
- Login works
- Refresh page
- Logged out again

**Causes:**
- Cookie not being saved
- Cookie expires immediately
- Browser blocking cookies

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser cookie settings
2. Allow cookies for your domain
3. Check cookie expiration in DevTools
4. Try different browser

## Environment Variables Check

Verify these are set correctly in `.env.local`:

```env
# Must match your Appwrite project
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here

# Server-only - for API routes
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**How to verify:**
1. Go to Appwrite Console
2. Settings > General
3. Compare Project ID
4. Settings > API Keys
5. Compare API Key

## Code Changes Summary

### `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Signup function:**
```diff
- // Delete any existing sessions first
- try {
-     await account.deleteSessions();
- } catch {
-     console.log('No existing sessions to delete');
- }

  // Create account
  await account.create(ID.unique(), email, password, name);
```

**Login function:**
```diff
- // Delete any existing sessions first to avoid conflict
- try {
-     await account.deleteSessions();
- } catch {
-     console.log('No existing sessions to delete');
- }

+ // Try to delete current session if one exists
+ try {
+     const currentSession = await account.getSession('current');
+     if (currentSession) {
+         await account.deleteSession('current');
+     }
+ } catch {
+     console.log('No current session to delete');
+ }

  // Create email session
  await account.createEmailPasswordSession(email, password);
```

### `src/app/auth/page.tsx`

**Added logging:**
```diff
  try {
      if (isLogin) {
+         console.log('Attempting login...');
          await login(email, password)
+         console.log('Login successful');
      }
  } catch (err: unknown) {
+     console.error('Auth error:', err);
      setLocalError(errorMessage)
  }
```

## Expected Console Output

### Successful Login Flow:
```
1. "Attempting login..."
2. "No current session to delete"
3. (Appwrite API calls in Network tab)
4. "Login successful"
5. (Navigate to /role)
```

### Successful Signup Flow:
```

```

## When to Contact Support

If after following all debugging steps:
- ✅ Environment variables are correct
- ✅ Console shows no errors
- ✅ Network requests are successful
- ✅ Session cookie is set
- ❌ Still can't login or access pages

Then there may be a deeper issue with:
- Appwrite server configuration
- Project settings
- API key permissions
- Network/firewall issues

Check Appwrite Console > Logs for server-side errors.
