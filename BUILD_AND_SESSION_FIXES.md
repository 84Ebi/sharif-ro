# Build and Session Issues - Fixed

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Build Error - Module Not Found

**Error Message:**
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../lib/useAuth'
```

**Cause:**
Multiple files were still importing from the old `useAuth` hook located at `src/lib/useAuth.ts`, which was deleted during the auth system migration.

**Solution:**
Updated all imports from `../../lib/useAuth` to `@/contexts/AuthContext` in the following files:

#### Files Updated:
1. ✅ `src/app/courier/page.tsx`
2. ✅ `src/app/customer/page.tsx`
3. ✅ `src/app/customer/my-orders/page.tsx`
4. ✅ `src/app/customer/shopping-cart/page.tsx`
5. ✅ `src/app/delivery/orders/page.tsx`
6. ✅ `src/app/waiting/page.tsx`
7. ✅ `src/app/delivery/page.tsx`
8. ✅ `src/app/order/page.tsx`
9. ✅ `src/app/delivery/verify/page.tsx`
10. ✅ `src/app/service/page.tsx`
11. ✅ `src/app/grocery/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '../../lib/useAuth'
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext'
```

### Issue 2: Session Conflict Error

**Error Message:**
```
Creation of a session is prohibited when a session is active.
```

**Cause:**
When users tried to log in, the system attempted to create a new session while an old/stale session was still active in Appwrite. This conflict prevented login.

**Additional Issue:**
When manually navigating to the role page, users with stale sessions were being sent back to the login page because the session cookie existed but wasn't valid with Appwrite.

**Solution:**
Updated the `login()` and `signup()` functions in `AuthContext.tsx` to delete all existing sessions before creating a new one.

#### Changes Made:

**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Login Function:**
```typescript
const login = async (email: string, password: string) => {
    try {
        setError(null);
        setLoading(true);

        // Delete any existing sessions first to avoid conflict
        try {
            await account.deleteSessions();
        } catch (deleteError) {
            // Ignore error if no sessions exist
            console.log('No existing sessions to delete');
        }

        // Create email session
        await account.createEmailPasswordSession(email, password);

        // Refresh user data
        await refreshUser();

        // Redirect logic...
    } catch (err) {
        // Error handling...
    }
};
```

**Signup Function:**
```typescript
const signup = async (email: string, password: string, name: string) => {
    try {
        setError(null);
        setLoading(true);

        // Delete any existing sessions first
        try {
            await account.deleteSessions();
        } catch (deleteError) {
            // Ignore error if no sessions exist
            console.log('No existing sessions to delete');
        }

        // Create account
        await account.create(ID.unique(), email, password, name);

        // Automatically log in after signup
        await account.createEmailPasswordSession(email, password);

        // Rest of the logic...
    } catch (err) {
        // Error handling...
    }
};
```

## How It Works Now

### Login Flow:

```
User enters credentials
    ↓
AuthContext.login() called
    ↓
Delete all existing sessions (if any)
    ↓
Create new email/password session
    ↓
Refresh user data
    ↓
Check for redirect parameter
    ↓
Redirect to /role or original destination
```

### Why This Fix Works:

1. **Cleans up stale sessions**: Any old/invalid sessions are removed before creating a new one
2. **Prevents conflicts**: No session conflicts occur since we start fresh
3. **Handles errors gracefully**: If there are no sessions to delete, the error is caught and ignored
4. **Maintains security**: Still uses Appwrite's secure session management

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Case 1: Fresh Login
```
1. Open the website (not logged in)
2. Go to /auth
3. Enter email and password
4. Click login
✅ Expected: Successfully logs in and redirects to /role
```

### Test Case 2: Login with Stale Session
```
1. Have an old session in browser
2. Try to login
✅ Expected: Old session deleted, new session created, login succeeds
```

### Test Case 3: Signup
```
1. Go to /auth
2. Click "Register for free"
3. Fill in name, email, password
4. Submit
✅ Expected: Account created, auto-logged in, redirected to /auth/details
```

### Test Case 4: Navigate to Protected Route
```
1. Login successfully
2. Navigate to /role
✅ Expected: Page loads correctly, no redirect back to auth
```

### Test Case 5: Build Test
```
1. Run: npm run build
✅ Expected: Build completes successfully with no module errors
```

## Build Success

After these fixes, the build should complete successfully:

```bash
npm run build
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Creating an optimized production build
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages
✓ Finalizing page optimization

Build completed successfully
```

## Deployment

The app is now ready to deploy. The build should complete successfully on Vercel or any other hosting platform.

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix build errors and session conflicts"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   - Vercel will automatically detect the push and start a new deployment
   - The build should complete successfully

3. **Verify:**
   - Test login functionality
   - Test signup functionality
   - Verify protected routes work correctly

## Additional Notes

### Why Delete All Sessions?

- **Safety**: Ensures no stale/invalid sessions cause conflicts
- **User Experience**: Users can login without errors
- **Security**: Old sessions are cleaned up properly
- **Simplicity**: One clear session per user at a time

### Alternative Approaches Considered:

1. ❌ **Check if session exists before creating** - Still leaves stale sessions
2. ❌ **Only delete current session** - Might miss sessions from other devices
3. ✅ **Delete all sessions then create new one** - Clean slate, most reliable

### Future Improvements:

- [ ] Implement session refresh instead of delete/recreate
- [ ] Add multi-device session management UI
- [ ] Implement "Remember me" functionality
- [ ] Add session expiry warnings
