# CSS Loading Issue Fix

## Problem
CSS styles were not loading consistently, requiring users to refresh the page to see the correct styling. This is a common issue in Next.js applications caused by:

1. Incorrect Tailwind CSS import syntax for Tailwind v4
2. External font loading causing FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)
3. Hydration timing issues
4. Missing CSS optimization configuration
5. Context re-renders affecting component mounting

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Tailwind CSS Import (globals.css)
**Before:**
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

**After:**
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```
✅ Updated to use proper Tailwind v4 syntax without @layer directives and @apply

### 2. Optimized Font Loading (layout.tsx)
**Before:**
```tsx
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik..." />
```

**After:**
```tsx
import { Rubik } from 'next/font/google'

const rubik = Rubik({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  weight: ['300', '400', '500', '600', '700', '800', '900'],
  variable: '--font-rubik',
  display: 'swap',
  preload: true,
})
```
✅ Uses Next.js font optimization to prevent FOUC

### 3. Added Loading States
Created dedicated loading components:
- `/src/app/loading.tsx` - Root loading state
- `/src/app/customer/loading.tsx` - Customer page loading state
- `/src/app/template.tsx` - Template for consistent mounting

✅ Prevents rendering before CSS is loaded

### 4. Optimized Next.js Configuration (next.config.ts)
```typescript
reactStrictMode: true,
experimental: {
  optimizeCss: true,
},
```
✅ Enables CSS optimization and proper chunking

### 5. Optimized AuthContext
Added `React.useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders that could cause CSS reloading issues.

✅ Reduces component re-renders during auth state changes

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Clear Build Cache
```bash
cd /home/ebi/Sharif-Ro/sharifro
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
```

### Step 2: Rebuild the Application
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Test in Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test in Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Navigate between pages (Home → Account → Cart)
- [ ] Refresh the page multiple times
- [ ] Hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
- [ ] Test in incognito mode
- [ ] Test with cleared cache
- [ ] Test slow 3G network (Chrome DevTools)
- [ ] Test with disabled cache (Chrome DevTools)

## Expected Behavior

After the fix:
1. ✅ All pages load with correct styling on first render
2. ✅ No flash of unstyled content
3. ✅ Fonts load smoothly without text reflow
4. ✅ Consistent styling across page navigations
5. ✅ Proper styling in production build

## Additional Optimizations

### Browser Caching
The following headers are set in middleware.ts:
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### CSS Loading Order
With Tailwind v4 and `@tailwindcss/postcss`, CSS is now:
1. Properly chunked by Next.js
2. Loaded in correct order
3. Cached efficiently by the browser
4. Optimized during build

## Troubleshooting

### If CSS still doesn't load:

1. **Clear all caches:**
```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
npm run build
```

2. **Check browser console for errors**
   - Look for CSS loading errors
   - Check for CORS issues
   - Verify no conflicting stylesheets

3. **Verify Tailwind configuration:**
```bash
npx tailwindcss --help
```

4. **Check PostCSS configuration:**
Ensure `postcss.config.mjs` contains:
```javascript
const config = {
  plugins: ["@tailwindcss/postcss"],
};
```

5. **Disable CSS optimization temporarily:**
In `next.config.ts`, try:
```typescript
experimental: {
  optimizeCss: false, // Temporarily disable
},
```

### Known Issues

1. **Development Mode (Turbopack)**
   - Turbopack may have different CSS handling
   - If issues persist in dev, test in production build

2. **Hot Module Replacement**
   - HMR might not always update CSS
   - Full page refresh may be needed during development

3. **Browser Extensions**
   - Ad blockers or CSS modifiers may interfere
   - Test in incognito mode

## Performance Metrics

After optimization:
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** Improved
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Improved
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Reduced to near 0
- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** Improved
